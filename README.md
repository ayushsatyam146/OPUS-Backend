# OPUS-Backend
Introducing OPUS, a Turing complete musical programming language. OPUS enables you to write code in functional style of programming with the help of MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) devices. We aim to crease a text editor catered to the specific needs of our language, providing an interface for our compiler, OPUS. The software gives output as a piece of code which is a musical piece as well.
